Take Durham weather data in file DurhamWeather1850_2022.xlsx which is in the format:
year, month, day, max temp, min temp, rainfall

and output in the format
year, mean temperature, annual rainfall

Checks that the data file exists in the current working directory before doing anything
and tell the user how many days of data have been read in / written out
